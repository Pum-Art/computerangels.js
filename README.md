Make sure your website is secured from malicious attacks, and hackers, by including computerangels.js

Computer Angels add an extra level of security to your website!

You can easily add Computer Angels to your website with these powerful few lines of javascript:
```javascript
//add the following between your page's <head></head> tag:
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="computerangels.js"></script>

//call the following on page load:
<body onLoad="release_the_angels(20, true);">
```
Depending on the amount of Computer Angels you want you either pass it a larger, or smaller, number.
Passing it true/false either enables or disables the website protection notice.
Note: the higher the number, the more protected your website is.
